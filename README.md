# 🔐 IAM Solution Design – TCS Cybersecurity Virtual Experience

> Role: IAM Developer | Company Simulation: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)  
> Client: TechCorp Enterprises – Global Technology Conglomerate

## 📚 Project Overview

In this virtual consulting simulation, I acted as an Identity & Access Management (IAM) developer for TCS. I assessed TechCorp Enterprises’ readiness for IAM deployment, proposed a customized architecture, and developed an implementation plan that addressed security, usability, and scalability.

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- IAM Fundamentals: authentication, authorization, identity lifecycle
- Access Control Models: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), least privilege
- Readiness Evaluation: IAM maturity scoring and risk analysis
- System Integration Planning: HR systems, cloud access (Azure AD/Okta)
- Compliance Considerations: GDPR-aligned access design

---

## 🗂 Deliverables

### ✅ IAM Readiness Assessment  
Analyzed TechCorp's current access control infrastructure and scored maturity across identity provisioning, deprovisioning, auditability, and federation.

### ✅ IAM Architecture Proposal  
Outlined a secure IAM framework using:
- Role definitions mapped to business units
- Policy-based access management
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Logging and SIEM integration

### ✅ Implementation Roadmap  
Defined a 3-phase rollout plan including:
1. Core IAM Platform Selection
2. User Role Mapping and SSO Deployment
3. Continuous Monitoring and Governance
